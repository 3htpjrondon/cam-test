# IBM Multicloud Manager on IBM Cloud Private clusters
Copyright IBM Corp. 2019, 2019 \
This code is released under the Apache 2.0 License.

## Overview
 This terraform template loads the IBM Multicloud Manager v 3.1.1 Docker images and Helm charts from an external binary (.tgz) into an existing ICP cluster. It requires access to the boot node of the cluster. After the execution of this template is done, two new helm charts named ibm-mcm-prod (MCM controller) and ibm-mcmk-prod (MCM klusterlet) will be available through the IBM Cloud Private catalog

## Prerequisites
* An existing IBM Cloud Private cluster where the MCM charts will be loaded into
* Location of the binary file that contains the MCM Docker images and Helm charts 

## Automation summary
The terraform template performs the following activities to install the MCM artifacts into an existing IBM Cloud Private cluster:
* connects to the ICP boot node and downloads the MCM .tgz in a temporary folder
* installs the kubectl, cloudctl and helm clients if not present 
* creates the MCM secrets
* runs the `cloudctl catalog load-ppa-archive` CLI which loads the Docker images and Helm charts into the ICP catalog
